# Codility_Assessment_review
 
This is an actual assessment for Senior Data Analyst position at a FTSE100 company.

The take home asssessment consisted of two tasks.

1. Python
2. SQL

I share the solutions from the test to the best of my knowledge as well as tips and tricks of what to look out.

I have also included test data in both tasks. 

For SQL I have both a python sqlite and an sql script you can run. (You will need to have created a database for sql script.)

Thanks,

Andreas
